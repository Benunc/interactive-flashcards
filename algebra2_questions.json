        {
            "question": "What is the domain of the function f(x) = √(x + 3)?",
            "options": [
                "x ≥ -3",
                "x > -3",
                "x ≤ -3",
                "x < -3"
            ],
            "answer": 0,
            "explanation": "The domain of a square root function includes all x-values that make the expression under the root non-negative. Therefore, x + 3 ≥ 0, which means x ≥ -3."
        },
        {
            "question": "Which of the following is the correct factorization of x² - 9?",
            "options": [
                "(x + 3)(x - 3)",
                "(x + 3)(x + 3)",
                "(x - 3)(x - 3)",
                "(x + 9)(x - 1)"
            ],
            "answer": 0,
            "explanation": "This is a difference of squares, which follows the pattern a² - b² = (a + b)(a - b). Here, x² - 9 = x² - 3² = (x + 3)(x - 3)."
        },

            ],
            "answer": 0,
            "explanation": "16 can be written as 2⁴. So, 2^(x+1) = 2⁴. Therefore, x + 1 = 4, which means x = 3."

            ],
            "answer": 0,
            "explanation": "To find the inverse, swap x and y and solve for y: x = 2y + 3 → x - 3 = 2y → y = (x - 3)/2"
        },
        {
            "question": "What is the vertex of the parabola y = x² - 4x + 3?",

            "answer": 0,
            "explanation": "The x-coordinate of the vertex is -b/2a = -(-4)/2(1) = 2. Substituting x = 2 into the equation gives y = 2² - 4(2) + 3 = -1."

            ],
            "answer": 0,
            "explanation": "The period of sin(x) is 2π. When the argument is multiplied by 2, the period is divided by 2, giving π."

            ],
            "answer": 0,
            "explanation": "Adding the equations eliminates y: 5x = 15, so x = 3. Substituting into the first equation: 2(3) + y = 5, so y = -1."
